            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Lisa Michelle Burns</h2>
            <p>I wasn't one of those people who was given a camera at age five and fell in love with photography.</p>
            <p>I was a travel journalist, working my dream job with Lonely Planet at age 23 when the magic of Marrakech begged me to take its photo.</p>
            <p>Since that trip in 2007 I became hooked on photographing patterns hidden within landscapes, extreme climates, cultures and the underwater world. My business <span class="linkedsite"> <a href="http://www.thewanderinglens.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wandering Lens</a></span>, works with global brands producing visual content and image libraries/editorials for various publications, tourism/commercial clients and also operates as a travel photography site, which is now the leading publisher of travel guides for photographers. </p>
            <p>In 2009 I opened a landscape gallery on Hayman Island with the glimmering Great Barrier Reef at my doorstep for six years.</p>
            <p>This location led to my obsession of     documenting the environment above and below the surface. It’s the details of nature that inspire my photography. Patterns carved by climates, movement in water and colourful skies, I believe photography is as much about seeing as it is capturing.</p>
            <p>My recent project, The Photographic Forecast, focuses on regions of environmental significance. Images from Greenland to Namibia, Chile and Australia feature in a print collection from which proceeds are donated to conservation initiatives. Click here to view the available fine art prints.</p>
            <p>Gear wise I'm very proud to be an Olympus Visionary, working with the incredible team from Olympus Australia to showcase what this innovative brand is capable of. The OM-D E-M1 MKII is my go to camera; it's weatherproof, lightweight and has been with me underwater, in arctic conditions and searing tropical heat without failing once.</p>
            <p>I prefer to let the photos do the talking so if you wish to know more just ask via hello@thewanderinglens.com, I'd love to hear from you.</p></div>
